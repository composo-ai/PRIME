We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details",

We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details",

We will try to give them a hard time.\"\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\nBahrain GP qualifying results\nBahrain GP coverage details",

We used IL-13-transformed, highly enriched goblet cells and differentiated (ciliary cell-enriched) human bronchial epithelial cell culture to evaluate the relative contribution of ciliated and goblet cells to airway sPLA2 generation and response. We wished to determine the primary source(s) of sPLA2 and leukotrienes in human airway epithelial cells.\nHuman bronchial epithelial cells from subjects without lung disease were differentiated to a ciliated-enriched or goblet-enriched cell phenotype. Synthesis of sPLA2, cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), and airway mucin messenger RNA and protein was measured by real-time-polymerase chain reaction and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the localization of mucin and sPLA2 to specific cells types was confirmed by confocal microscopy.\nsPLA2 group IIa, V, and X messenger RNA expression was increased in ciliated-enriched cells (P < .001) but not in goblet-enriched cells. sPLA2 were secreted from the apical (air) side of ciliated-enriched cells but not goblet-enriched cells (P < .001). Immunostaining of sPLA2 V was strongly positive in ciliated-enriched cells but not in goblet-enriched cells. sPLA2 released cysLTs from goblet-enriched cells but not from ciliated-enriched cells, and this result was greatest with sPLA2 V (P < .05). sPLA2 V increased goblet-enriched cell mucin secretion, which was inhibited by inhibitors of lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase (P < .02).",

    "chosen": "Yes, certain enzymes called secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) are released from hairlike cells (ciliated cells) in the airway and they trigger mucus production and inflammatory substances from nearby mucus-producing (goblet) cells. The study you referenced indicates that sPLA2, particularly group V, is produced and secreted by ciliated-enriched cells rather than goblet-enriched cells.

The study you referenced indicates that sPLA2, particularly group V, is produced and secreted by ciliated-enriched cells rather than goblet-enriched cells. Once secreted, sPLA2 can release cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) from goblet-enriched cells, which suggests that sPLA2 acts on these goblet cells to enhance mucin secretion. Furthermore, the increase in mucin secretion induced by sPLA2 V was found to be dependent on the activity of lipoxygenase or cyclooxygenase, emphasizing the importance of eicosanoid signaling in this process. Overall, ciliated cells are the primary source of sPLA2 in this context, and sPLA2 enhances mucin and eicosanoid production in goblet cells.",

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated.\nThe aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease.\nA cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score.\n35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited.

We wished to determine the primary source(s) of sPLA2 and leukotrienes in human airway epithelial cells.\nHuman bronchial epithelial cells from subjects without lung disease were differentiated to a ciliated-enriched or goblet-enriched cell phenotype. Synthesis of sPLA2, cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs), and airway mucin messenger RNA and protein was measured by real-time-polymerase chain reaction and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the localization of mucin and sPLA2 to specific cells types was confirmed by confocal microscopy.\nsPLA2 group IIa, V, and X messenger RNA expression was increased in ciliated-enriched cells (P < .001) but not in goblet-enriched cells. sPLA2 were secreted from the apical (air) side of ciliated-enriched cells but not goblet-enriched cells (P < .001).

A high lymphocytic infiltration has been associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but the contribution to response and prognosis of immune cell subpopulations profiles in both pre-treated and post-treatment residual tumor is still unclear.\nWe analyzed pre- and post-treatment tumor-infiltrating immune cells (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD20, CD68, Foxp3) by immunohistochemistry in a series of 121 breast cancer patients homogeneously treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Immune cell profiles were analyzed and correlated with response and survival.\nWe identified three tumor-infiltrating immune cell profiles, which were able to predict pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (cluster B: 58%, versus clusters A and C: 7%). A higher infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes was the main factor explaining the occurrence of pCR, and this association was validated in six public genomic datasets. A higher chemotherapy effect on lymphocytic infiltration, including an inversion of CD4/CD8 ratio, was associated with pCR and with better prognosis.

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated.\nThe aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease.\nA cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score.\n35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease.

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.\n8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks.\nHV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice. However, disruption of the hepatic afferent vagus nerve by capsaicin failed to reverse either the protection against the HFD-induced obesity or the development of HF-induced steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.",

The study demonstrates that hepatic vagal innervation mediates the resistance to diet-induced adiposity and the susceptibility to hepatic steatosis in Pemt(-/-) mice through modulation of hepatic phospholipid homeostasis and inflammatory cascades. \n\nSpecifically, hepatic vagotomy (HV) abrogated the protective effects normally seen in Pemt(-/-) mice against HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. After HV, the normalized phospholipid content and the prevention of steatohepatitis observed in these mice suggest that the vagus nerve is crucial in regulating inflammation and lipid metabolism in the context of PEMT deficiency.\n\nFurthermore, the study reveals that HV led to increases in the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and decreases in inflammatory markers, as well as the normalization of various proteins related to mitochondrial function and fatty acid synthesis. This underscores the vagus nerve's role in inflammation and metabolic regulation under dietary stress.\n\nIn contrast, the disruption of hepatic afferent nerves through capsaicin treatment did not alter the protective mechanisms against HFD-induced obesity or the development of steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. This indicates that the mechanism through which the vagus nerve operates may not solely depend on afferent signaling but could involve different pathways or efferent influences.\n\nIn summary, the data strongly support the involvement of the vagus nerve in the metabolic responses of PEMT-deficient mice, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and liver disease.",

Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated.\nThe aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease.\nA cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry.

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.\n8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks.\nHV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice.

In 92 (30.2%) patients, FT was unsuccessful and rescue PCI was performed. Admission glucose (126 [99-192] vs. 110 [94-144] mg/dL, p<0.001), time from symptom onset to FT (180 [120-270] vs. 150 [120-180] min, p=0.009), and maximum ST elevation amplitude (3 [2-7] vs. 3 [2-6] mm, p=0.05) were higher in the failed reperfusion group than in the reperfusion group.

Additionally, the effective potency of PsA would have been evaluated using an in vivo xenograft model to better understand its therapeutic potential against multidrug-resistant cancers.\n\nWhile the specific results are not detailed here, research indicates that Psammaplin A functions as a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that can influence Sirtuin 1 activity, which regulates autophagy through deacetylation of key autophagy-related proteins like Atg5, Atg7, and LC3, potentially offering a novel therapeutic approach for overcoming doxorubicin resistance in breast cancer. Further details from experimental findings would be necessary to confirm these specific effects of PsA.",

When fed a high-fat diet (HFD), Pemt(-/-) mice are protected from HF-induced obesity; however, they develop steatohepatitis. The vagus nerve relays signals between liver and brain that regulate peripheral adiposity and pancreas function. Here we explore a possible role of the hepatic branch of the vagus nerve in the development of diet induced obesity and steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice.\n8-week old Pemt(-/-) and Pemt(+/+) mice were subjected to hepatic vagotomy (HV) or capsaicin treatment, which selectively disrupts afferent nerves, and were compared to sham-operated or vehicle-treatment, respectively. After surgery, mice were fed a HFD for 10 weeks.\nHV abolished the protection against the HFD-induced obesity and glucose intolerance in Pemt(-/-) mice. HV normalized phospholipid content and prevented steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. Moreover, HV increased the hepatic anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10, reduced chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1 and the ER stress marker C/EBP homologous protein. Furthermore, HV normalized the expression of mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins and of proteins involved in fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA carboxylase and fatty acid synthase in Pemt(-/-) mice.

After HV, the normalized phospholipid content and the prevention of steatohepatitis observed in these mice suggest that the vagus nerve is crucial in regulating inflammation and lipid metabolism in the context of PEMT deficiency.\n\nFurthermore, the study reveals that HV led to increases in the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 and decreases in inflammatory markers, as well as the normalization of various proteins related to mitochondrial function and fatty acid synthesis. This underscores the vagus nerve's role in inflammation and metabolic regulation under dietary stress.\n\nIn contrast, the disruption of hepatic afferent nerves through capsaicin treatment did not alter the protective mechanisms against HFD-induced obesity or the development of steatohepatitis in Pemt(-/-) mice. This indicates that the mechanism through which the vagus nerve operates may not solely depend on afferent signaling but could involve different pathways or efferent influences.\n\nIn summary, the data strongly support the involvement of the vagus nerve in the metabolic responses of PEMT-deficient mice, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for obesity and liver disease.",

This behavior is different from earlier releases. With these versions, when Streams is run as a system service, application environment variables must be set with streamtool. \n\nCONTENT\nProblem Description\nWhen running Streams as a system service with Streams releases 4.1.1.1\nor 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the\nuser environment may have various errors.\nFor example the database toolkit might show the following error\nif it does not pick up the ODBCINI environment variable:\n\n\n\n * \"An SQL operation failed.

This is a change in behavior from earlier releases, as you noted.\n\n### Problem Summary:\nWhen IBM Streams is run as a system service in the specified versions, it does not inherit user-specific environment variables from the `.bashrc`. This may cause applications, such as the database toolkit, to fail due to missing environment variables (e.g., `ODBCINI`), leading to errors like:\n\n```\nAn SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Connection does not exist.\n```\n\n### Workaround:\nTo fix this problem, you need to tell the system directly which settings to use, rather than relying on your personal settings file. You can do this with a special command, as shown below:\n\n```bash\nstreamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance> --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n```\n\n### Example:\nIf you need to set the `ODBCINI` variable for your application, you would use a command like:\n\n```bash\nstreamtool setproperty -d your_domain -i your_instance --application-ev ODBCINI=/path/to/odbc.ini\n```\n\n### Next Steps:\n1.

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system. This IBM Education Assistant Module/PDF : IBM WebSphere Application Server V8 Distributed platform installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/topic/com.ibm.iea.was_v8/was/8.0/Installation/WASV8_dist_install.pdf] , demonstrates selecting a 32-bit or 64-bit SDK as part of a WAS v8.0 install using IBM Installation manager.

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List.

These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)).

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system. This IBM Education Assistant Module/PDF : IBM WebSphere Application Server V8 Distributed platform installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/topic/com.ibm.iea.was_v8/was/8.0/Installation/WASV8_dist_install.pdf] , demonstrates selecting a 32-bit or 64-bit SDK as part of a WAS v8.0 install using IBM Installation manager. If the WAS v8.0 installation is on a 32-bit operating system, this feature choice between IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0 or IBM 64-bit SDK Java 6.0 is not available and the installation will automatically default to the IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0. \n\nThe shipped WebSphere Portal Server v6.x/7.x servers are 32 bit or 64 bit editions. depending on whether you chose the IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, 32-bit or 64-bit server to install on. \n\nNote: It is possible to work with any 64 bit remotely accessible or local stand-alone WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x/8.x.

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system. This IBM Education Assistant Module/PDF : IBM WebSphere Application Server V8 Distributed platform installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/topic/com.ibm.iea.was_v8/was/8.0/Installation/WASV8_dist_install.pdf] , demonstrates selecting a 32-bit or 64-bit SDK as part of a WAS v8.0 install using IBM Installation manager. If the WAS v8.0 installation is on a 32-bit operating system, this feature choice between IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0 or IBM 64-bit SDK Java 6.0 is not available and the installation will automatically default to the IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0. \n\nThe shipped WebSphere Portal Server v6.x/7.x servers are 32 bit or 64 bit editions. depending on whether you chose the IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, 32-bit or 64-bit server to install on. \n\nNote: It is possible to work with any 64 bit remotely accessible or local stand-alone WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x/8.x.

This behavior is different from earlier releases. With these versions, when Streams is run as a system service, application environment variables must be set with streamtool. \n\nCONTENT\nProblem Description\nWhen running Streams as a system service with Streams releases 4.1.1.1\nor 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the\nuser environment may have various errors.\nFor example the database toolkit might show the following error\nif it does not pick up the ODBCINI environment variable:\n\n\n\n * \"An SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code\n   is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver\n   Manager]Connnection does not exist.\"\n * \n\nProblem Solution \n\nTo work around the issue, set environment variables that are needed by the application directly in the instance with:  * \n   \n * streamtool setproperty\n * -d <domain> -i <instance>\n   --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n * \n   \n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n APAR IT18432 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT18432]\n",

This change in behavior can lead to errors in applications that rely on these environment variables, such as the database toolkit failing with an SQL error due to the `ODBCINI` variable not being set.\n\n### Symptoms:\n- The database toolkit or applications may return errors such as:\n  ```\n  An SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Connection does not exist.\n  ```\n- Environment variables defined in the user’s `.bashrc` file do not seem to apply when Streams is run.\n\n### Workaround:\nTo resolve this issue, you need to explicitly set the required environment variables for your application using the `streamtool` command. Here's how you can do this:\n\n1. **Use the `streamtool` command:**\n   You will need to set environment variables directly in the Streams instance. Use the following command in your terminal:\n\n   ```\n   streamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance> --application-ev <VARIABLE_NAME>=<VARIABLE_VALUE>\n   ```\n\n   Replace `<domain>` with your specific domain name, `<instance>` with your specific instance name, and `<VARIABLE_NAME>` with the environment variable you need to set (e.g., `ODBCINI`), along with `<VARIABLE_VALUE>` as the appropriate value for that variable.\n\n### Example:\nIf you need to set the `ODBCINI` environment variable, you can run:\n\n```\nstreamtool setproperty -d myDomain -i myInstance --application-ev ODBCINI=/path/to/your/odbc.ini\n```\n\n### Additional Information:\nFor further information, you may refer to APAR IT18432, which provides detailed insights about this situation, and possible fixes or updates in future releases from IBM.",

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List.

These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)).

This behavior is different from earlier releases. With these versions, when Streams is run as a system service, application environment variables must be set with streamtool. \n\nCONTENT\nProblem Description\nWhen running Streams as a system service with Streams releases 4.1.1.1\nor 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the\nuser environment may have various errors.\nFor example the database toolkit might show the following error\nif it does not pick up the ODBCINI environment variable:\n\n\n\n * \"An SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code\n   is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver\n   Manager]Connnection does not exist.\"\n * \n\nProblem Solution \n\nTo work around the issue, set environment variables that are needed by the application directly in the instance with:  * \n   \n * streamtool setproperty\n * -d <domain> -i <instance>\n   --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n * \n   \n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n APAR IT18432 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT18432]\n",

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List.

These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)).

This behavior is different from earlier releases. With these versions, when Streams is run as a system service, application environment variables must be set with streamtool. \n\nCONTENT\nProblem Description\nWhen running Streams as a system service with Streams releases 4.1.1.1\nor 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the\nuser environment may have various errors.\nFor example the database toolkit might show the following error\nif it does not pick up the ODBCINI environment variable:\n\n\n\n * \"An SQL operation failed.

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system.

This change in behavior can be frustrating, especially if your applications rely heavily on these environment variables.\n\n### Issue Overview\nIn versions 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2, when IBM Streams is run as a system service, it no longer picks up environment variables set in a user's `.bashrc`. This is a departure from previous behavior, leading to problems with applications that rely on environment variables such as `ODBCINI`, resulting in errors like:\n\n```\nAn SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver Manager] Connection does not exist.\n```\n\n### Workaround Solution\nTo fix this problem, you'll need to manually add your special settings directly to your IBM Streams software instead of relying on your regular computer settings. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Use the following `streamtool` command to set the necessary environment variable:\n   ```\n   streamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance> --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n   ```\n   - Replace `<domain>` with your specific domain.\n   - Replace `<instance>` with the name of your instance.\n   - Replace `<VARIABLE NAME>` with the name of the environment variable (e.g., ODBCINI).\n   - Replace `<VARIABLE VALUE>` with the value you wish to assign to that variable.\n\n### Example Command\nIf you needed to set the `ODBCINI` variable to `/path/to/odbc.ini`, your command would look something like this:\n```\nstreamtool setproperty -d myDomain -i myInstance --application-ev ODBCINI=/path/to/odbc.ini\n```\n\n### Further Action\nIf you continue to face issues or require more detailed assistance, consider checking the relevant IBM support documentation or contacting IBM support to report your situation and follow any further recommendations they might have.\n\nIt's also noteworthy to keep an eye on the APAR IT18432 for updates and patches that may address this issue in future releases.",

This behavior is different from earlier releases. With these versions, when Streams is run as a system service, application environment variables must be set with streamtool. \n\nCONTENT\nProblem Description\nWhen running Streams as a system service with Streams releases 4.1.1.1\nor 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the\nuser environment may have various errors.\nFor example the database toolkit might show the following error\nif it does not pick up the ODBCINI environment variable:\n\n\n\n * \"An SQL operation failed.

This change in behavior can lead to various errors, particularly for applications that rely on these environment variables, such as the database toolkit failing to connect due to the ODBCINI variable not being set correctly.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you will need to manually set the necessary environment variables for your Streams application instance. Here’s how you can do that using the `streamtool` command:\n\n1. Open a terminal where you can run `streamtool`.\n2. Use the following command to set the required environment variable:\n\n   ```bash\n   streamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance> --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n   ```\n\nReplace `<domain>` with your specific Streams domain, `<instance>` with the name of your Streams instance, `<VARIABLE NAME>` with the name of the environment variable (e.g., `ODBCINI`), and `<VARIABLE VALUE>` with the path or value you need.\n\nFor example, if you need to set `ODBCINI`, the command may look something like this:\n\n```bash\nstreamtool setproperty -d myDomain -i myInstance --application-ev ODBCINI=/path/to/odbc.ini\n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Ensure that you replace the placeholders with the actual values pertinent to your environment.\n- This command needs to be run every time you initialize your Streams application if you rely on it for your environment settings.\n\nFor further reference, you can check the related APAR IT18432 for more on this issue.",

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system. This IBM Education Assistant Module/PDF : IBM WebSphere Application Server V8 Distributed platform installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/topic/com.ibm.iea.was_v8/was/8.0/Installation/WASV8_dist_install.pdf] , demonstrates selecting a 32-bit or 64-bit SDK as part of a WAS v8.0 install using IBM Installation manager. If the WAS v8.0 installation is on a 32-bit operating system, this feature choice between IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0 or IBM 64-bit SDK Java 6.0 is not available and the installation will automatically default to the IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0. \n\nThe shipped WebSphere Portal Server v6.x/7.x servers are 32 bit or 64 bit editions. depending on whether you chose the IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, 32-bit or 64-bit server to install on. \n\nNote: It is possible to work with any 64 bit remotely accessible or local stand-alone WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x/8.x.

This is a change in behavior from earlier releases, as you noted.\n\n### Problem Summary:\nWhen IBM Streams is run as a system service in the specified versions, it does not inherit user-specific environment variables from the `.bashrc`. This may cause applications, such as the database toolkit, to fail due to missing environment variables (e.g., `ODBCINI`), leading to errors like:\n\n```\nAn SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver Manager]Connection does not exist.\n```\n\n### Workaround:\nTo address this issue, you can set the necessary environment variables directly in the Streams instance using the `streamtool` command. Here is the syntax you can use:\n\n```bash\nstreamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance> --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n```\n\n### Example:\nIf you need to set the `ODBCINI` variable for your application, you would use a command like:\n\n```bash\nstreamtool setproperty -d your_domain -i your_instance --application-ev ODBCINI=/path/to/odbc.ini\n```\n\n### Next Steps:\n1.

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)).

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system.

This behavior is different from earlier releases. With these versions, when Streams is run as a system service, application environment variables must be set with streamtool. \n\nCONTENT\nProblem Description\nWhen running Streams as a system service with Streams releases 4.1.1.1\nor 4.1.1.2, toolkits and user applications that depend on the\nuser environment may have various errors.\nFor example the database toolkit might show the following error\nif it does not pick up the ODBCINI environment variable:\n\n\n\n * \"An SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code\n   is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver\n   Manager]Connnection does not exist.\"\n * \n\nProblem Solution \n\nTo work around the issue, set environment variables that are needed by the application directly in the instance with:  * \n   \n * streamtool setproperty\n * -d <domain> -i <instance>\n   --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n * \n   \n\n\nRELATED INFORMATION\n APAR IT18432 [https://www-01.ibm.com/support/entdocview.wss?uid=swg1IT18432]\n",

This change in behavior can be frustrating, especially if your applications rely heavily on these environment variables.\n\n### Issue Overview\nIn versions 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2, when IBM Streams is run as a system service, it no longer picks up environment variables set in a user's `.bashrc`. This is a departure from previous behavior, leading to problems with applications that rely on environment variables such as `ODBCINI`, resulting in errors like:\n\n```\nAn SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver Manager] Connection does not exist.\n```\n\n### Workaround Solution\nTo mitigate this regression in service initialization behavior, you'll need to propagate environment variables to the instance's application runtime context via the streamtool property modification interface. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. Open your terminal.\n2. Use the following `streamtool` command to set the necessary environment variable:\n   ```\n   streamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance> --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n   ```\n   - Replace `<domain>` with your specific domain.\n   - Replace `<instance>` with the name of your instance.\n   - Replace `<VARIABLE NAME>` with the name of the environment variable (e.g., ODBCINI).\n   - Replace `<VARIABLE VALUE>` with the value you wish to assign to that variable.\n\n### Example Command\nIf you needed to set the `ODBCINI` variable to `/path/to/odbc.ini`, your command would look something like this:\n```\nstreamtool setproperty -d myDomain -i myInstance --application-ev ODBCINI=/path/to/odbc.ini\n```\n\n### Further Action\nIf you continue to face issues or require more detailed assistance, consider checking the relevant IBM support documentation or contacting IBM support to report your situation and follow any further recommendations they might have.\n\nIt's also noteworthy to keep an eye on the APAR IT18432 for updates and patches that may address this issue in future releases.",

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7.

Rational Application Developer v8.0.3+ is available as a 64-bit application install on specified 64-bit operating systems, in addition to a 32-bit application install.\nThere is only one installation package. When installing RAD/RSA using IBM Installation Manager, on the Location page , if your operating system is 64-bit, then select 64-bit or 32-bit to install the product in the corresponding bit mode. \n\n \n\nThese products will be referred to generically as Rational Software Development Platform (RSDP) based products. For example, WebSphere Integration Developer v6.x/7.x is RSDP based. \n\nExamples of some 64 bit Operating Systems: \n\n * Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 Edition (running on an AMD or Intel processor) \n * Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit \n * Red Hat Linux Enterprise Server 4+ running on x86-64 bit \n * RAD 9.0 under 9.0.1 introduced support for Mac OS x - Lion 10.7 32 bit (with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 40) and Mountain Lion 10.8 - 32 bit. Likewise for RSA for WebSphere 9.0.0.1.\n   RAD 9.0.1.1 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS x Mavericks 10.9 ( with Oracle JDK for Mac OS X 7.0 Update 71)\n   RSA 9.1.2 introduced support for 64-bit exploit on Mac OS X Yosemite 10.10 and OS X El Capitan 10.11 (with Oracle JDK 7.0 Update 75 for OS X)\n\n\n\nNote: RSDP 32-bit JVM based products, do not require any additional or special set-up on a supported 64-bit operating system (O/S). \nThey run on the provided/supported 32-bit JVM for that RSDP product, as is. \n\nReview the following documents for more details on the system requirements: \n * (7014264) Rational Application Developer System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014264] \n * (7014274) Rational Software Architect Family System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014274] \n * (7014269) Rational Software Modeler System Requirements List [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27014269]\n   \n\n\nThe above items such as the Rational Application Developer System Requirements List cover latest versions and operating systems such as Windows Vista and Windows 7. Support is limited to 32 bit mode on 64 bit operating systems on all versions prior to Rational Application Developer 8.0.3. For more information consult: \nKnown problems and limitations to installing 64-bit Rational Application Developer [http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21499482] \nas referred to by the above Rational Application Developer System Requirements List. The following technote: \n- Benefits, requirements, limitations, and known issues for Rational Software Architect products running as 64-bit applications starting from v8.0.3 [http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg27021665] \n, especially Benefits, describes what is possible with a larger heap size with the 64-bit JVM. \n\nIn deciding if you want a 64-bit install of RAD/RSA, it is useful to know that the ClearCase SCM Adapter and the Rational RequisitePro integration features/plugins are not supported or provided. These are only available as 32-bit eclipse plugins. \n\nIf you have any further questions, contact IBM Support for Rational Application Developer, or the appropriate IBM RSDP product support team. \n\n\nWebSphere Servers that are shipped with RSDP products: \n\nThe various WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} prior to v8.0.4 are only provided as 32 bit editions. As of Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.4+, 64 bit editions of WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x servers are shipped in addition to the 32 bit editions. \n\nThe WebSphere Application Server v8.x (not beta) server shipped with Rational Application Developer or Rational Software Architect {for WebSphere} v8.0.3+ is provided as one edition, and there is an installation option to install either the 32 bit or 64 bit JVM/JRE (IBM Software Development Kit (SDK)). Any 64 bit edition or 64-bit JVM requires a supported 64 bit operating system. This IBM Education Assistant Module/PDF : IBM WebSphere Application Server V8 Distributed platform installation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/ieduasst/v1r1m0/topic/com.ibm.iea.was_v8/was/8.0/Installation/WASV8_dist_install.pdf] , demonstrates selecting a 32-bit or 64-bit SDK as part of a WAS v8.0 install using IBM Installation manager. If the WAS v8.0 installation is on a 32-bit operating system, this feature choice between IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0 or IBM 64-bit SDK Java 6.0 is not available and the installation will automatically default to the IBM 32-bit SDK Java 6.0. \n\nThe shipped WebSphere Portal Server v6.x/7.x servers are 32 bit or 64 bit editions. depending on whether you chose the IBM WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment, 32-bit or 64-bit server to install on. \n\nNote: It is possible to work with any 64 bit remotely accessible or local stand-alone WebSphere Application Server v6.x/7.x/8.x.

This is a departure from previous behavior, leading to problems with applications that rely on environment variables such as `ODBCINI`, resulting in errors like:\n\n```\nAn SQL operation failed.

Use the following `streamtool` command to set the necessary environment variable:\n   ```\n   streamtool setproperty -d <domain> -i <instance> --application-ev <VARIABLE NAME>=<VARIABLE VALUE>\n   ```\n   - Replace `<domain>` with your specific domain.\n   - Replace `<instance>` with the name of your instance.\n   - Replace `<VARIABLE NAME>` with the name of the environment variable (e.g., ODBCINI).\n   - Replace `<VARIABLE VALUE>` with the value you wish to assign to that variable.\n\n### Example Command\nIf you needed to set the `ODBCINI` variable to `/path/to/odbc.ini`, your command would look something like this:\n```\nstreamtool setproperty -d myDomain -i myInstance --application-ev ODBCINI=/path/to/odbc.ini\n```\n\n### Further Action\nIf you continue to face issues or require more detailed assistance, consider checking the relevant IBM support documentation or contacting IBM support to report your situation and follow any further recommendations they might have.\n\nIt's also noteworthy to keep an eye on the APAR IT18432 for updates and patches that may address this issue in future releases.",

This change in behavior can be frustrating, especially if your applications rely heavily on these environment variables.\n\n### Issue Overview\nIn versions 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2, when IBM Streams is run as a system service, it no longer picks up environment variables set in a user's `.bashrc`. This is a departure from previous behavior, leading to problems with applications that rely on environment variables such as `ODBCINI`, resulting in errors like:\n\n```\nAn SQL operation failed. The SQL state is 08003, the SQL code is 0 and the SQL message is [unixODBC][Driver Manager] Connection does not exist.\n```\n\n### Workaround Solution\nTo resolve this issue, you will need to explicitly set the required environment variables within the Stream instance using the `streamtool` command.
